# Stereolabs ZED Camera - ROS Navigation Tutorial

This package illustrates how to integrate the ZED [Terrain Mapping](https://www.stereolabs.com/developers/documentation/API/) module with the "[ROS Navigation](http://wiki.ros.org/navigation?distro=kinetic)" stack. 
The tutorial is mainly directed to ground robots and uses the Turtlebot as demo robotic platform.

## Getting started
